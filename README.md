# Project Pictum
Project Pictum is a small Unity game I did together with a friend in around a month.

## Technologies we used
We used the Unity engine to make the game. All the code is done in C#.
All the sprites were done in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), an open soure tool for creating pixel art.
